I created a fully responsive application inspired by the RAWG.io platform, using the official RAWG API. The project was designed and built from the ground up, offering a modern interface with support for light and dark modes.

Application functionalities
✅ Advanced game search – Navigation includes a dynamic search box with a list of suggestions, making it easy to quickly find titles of interest.

✅ Filtering by genre – List of game categories taken directly from the API. Each genre has its own dedicated sub-page.

✅ Infinite Scroll – The game list has been optimized for performance with the implementation of Infinite Query, allowing for smooth loading of the next results.

✅ Detailed game page – Clicking on a game tile takes the user to a detailed view, including:

Platform information, publisher, age category, and game rating.
User reviews presented in the form of an interactive graph.
A gallery of screenshots and gameplay footage in the form of a carousel.
A list of similar titles.
Links to shops where the title can be purchased.
✅ Library and wish list management – Users can add games to their library or place them on a wish list. Both sections are dynamically updated and include a filter option to quickly find titles of interest.

✅ Light and dark mode support – Users can switch between light and dark themes for a comfortable browsing experience.

✅ Skeleton loading states – Smooth skeleton loaders improve user experience by displaying placeholders while data is being fetched.

✅ Grid and list view toggle – Users can choose between tile-based (grid) or column-based (list) game display modes to suit their preference.

Technology Stack
✅ React & TypeScript – A modern, component-based architecture with type safety for better development experience.

✅ Vite – A fast build tool that ensures rapid development and optimized production builds.

✅ React Router – Handles client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between pages.

✅ React Query (TanStack Query) – Efficient data fetching, caching, and background synchronization for improved performance.

✅ Axios – Used for handling API requests, offering better error management and request optimization.

✅ Tailwind CSS & ShadCN – A combination of utility-first styling (Tailwind CSS) and accessible, pre-designed UI components (ShadCN) for a modern, aesthetic interface.
