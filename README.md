I created a fully responsive application inspired by the RAWG.io platform, using the official RAWG API. The project was designed and built from the ground up, offering a modern interface with support for light and dark modes.

Application functionalities
✅ Advanced game search - Navigation includes a dynamic search box with a list of suggestions, making it easy to quickly find titles of interest.

✅ Filtering by genre - List of game categories taken directly from the API. Each genre has its own dedicated sub-page.

✅ Infinite Scroll - The game list has been optimised for performance with the implementation of Infinite Query, allowing for smooth loading of the next results.

✅ Detailed game page - Clicking on a game tile takes the user to a detailed view, including:

Platform information, publisher, age category and game rating.
User reviews presented in the form of an interactive graph.
A gallery of screenshots and gameplay footage in the form of a carousel.
List of similar titles.
Links to shops where the title can be purchased.
✅ Library and wish list management - Users can add games to their library or place them on a wish list. Both sections are dynamically updated and include a filter option to quickly find titles of interest.
